# Towards Artificial General Intelligence in Battery Health Diagnostics: Predictive Optimized Modular Parallel Transformer (Prompt)
This repository contains the result source data and code of the PROMPT model proposed in our paper.
## Project Description

We propose a novel Transformer-based architecture called **PROMPT** (Predictive-Optimized Modular Parallel Transformer) to estimate battery health states. This repository provides:

- Model prediction results on real-world and lab datasets.
- Code for visualizing the results and errors of battery capacity estimation.
- These results are generated using the proposed model described in the paper.
